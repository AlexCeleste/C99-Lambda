Requirements:
-------------

C99 conformant (or later) preprocessor. Works with GCC, should work with Clang.
Does not appear to work with TCC or PCC. Unlikely to work at all with MSVC. The
continuation-machine is quite demanding on the preprocessor.

A willing suspension of disbelief. All code examples in this readme really are
standard-conformant ISO C, but it may be hard to believe. This is probably a
bad thing.


Usage:
------

#include "c_lambda.h"

That's all. It's just a tiny test project, after all. Now your namespace is
polluted with a bunch of bizarre macros.


Public syntax extension macros:
-------------------------------

The macros intended to be used at the top-level - i.e. in user code - are as
follows:


 namespace(<name>, ...<body>)
 func(<return type>, <name>, ...<body>)

Any code making use of the inline functions must appear inside one of these two
block constructs. These must appear at the global scope level, as they provide
the framework out of which the inner functions are lifted. They also provide a
root naming scheme for any contained functions. "func" is a convenience version
that links the namespace to the scope of a normal C function. Example:

 namespace(myFunctionList,
   typedef int(* fptr)(void);
   fptr functions[] = {
     fn(int, (void), { return 1; }),  // Simple function literals
     fn(int, (void), { return 2; }),
     fn(int, (void), { return 3; })
   };
 )
 
 func(int, myGlobalFunc, (int blah) {
     //...code here, presumably involving inner functions
 })

All namespaces must be unique. Typing namespacing to normal toplevel functions
helps enforce this, while also abstracting the need to think about a naming
scheme for anonymous objects. Since namespaces must be global, they should not
nest and should not appear within function scopes.


 fn(<return type>, <args>, ...<body>)

The main macro for generating an inline anonymous function. This cannot appear
outside a func() or namespace() block. Inner functions may nest to any depth
(within reason and the limits of the continuation machine). Example:

 typedef int(* fptr)(int);
 func(fptr, someFunc, (void) {
     return fn(int, (int a), {
         fptr f = fn(int, (int b), { return b * 6; });
         return a * f(a + 1);
     });
 })

Inline functions declared in this way may *not* appear within parentheses, for
any reason, even as a macro argument (don't do that). An exception exists, and
is below, but for the most part parentheses interfere with the macro expansion.
Anonymous functions using this form *may* appear in most other contexts:
 - as a return value (shown above)
 - in a braced initializer list, as above in an array, or for a struct
 - as the RHS of an assignment (shown above)
 - in the function-call position, as long as there are no containing parens.
   Example:

 //...
 foo = fn(int, (int a, int b), { return (a + b) * (b - a); })(4, 5);
 fn(void, (int c), { printf("Received c: %d\n", c); })(47);
 //...


 defn(<return type>, <name>, <args>, ...<body>)

Define a function, named and visible in the local scope. The same rules apply
as for fn() regarding parentheses and namespace blocks. Unlike fn(), defn() is
a statement, not an expression; as with a normal function declaration, it cannot
be called in-place or used as a value. Example:

 // Same code as above, using defn() instead of fn()
 defn(int, helper, (int a, int b), {
     return (a + b) * (b - a);
 })
 foo = helper(4, 5);
 //...

The name declared by defn() is a normal local constant containing a function
pointer, and can be used from then on as one would in normal C code.


 cl(<return type>, <args>, <free variables>, ...<body>)

This macro creates a closure object in-place, over the variables named in the
"second args list". The expression is subject to the same rules as fn() - must
appear within a namespace block, may not appear within parentheses - but also,
because it does not return a raw C function pointer, may not appear in the call
position (and therefore C syntax cannot call it like a function). The returned
value is a struct (declared at the same external site as the function body),
containing the function pointer and the values of the closed-over variables.
The struct is stack-allocated; returning the closure requires some user-defined
method of heap allocation. Example:

 // User supplies a big enough buffer here... dirty trickery
 func(void, makeAdder, (void * out_buf, int add) {
     *(sth *)out_buf = *(sth *)& cl(int, (int x), ((int, add)), {
                                     return x + _env->add;
                                 });
 })
 
 // Close over two variables, no args
 int x = 42, y = 47;
 cl(void, (...), ((int, x), (int, y)), {
     printf("%d, %d\n", _env->x, _env->y);
 });

OK, the first example technically involves undefined behaviour, but the syntax
is at least legal (if we assume "sth" to be a type of the required size for the
closure). In the second example, the closure takes no arguments; to indicate
this, the variadic tail should be used instead of "void". Also note how the
free variable list has a slightly more complicated form than the argument list.

Since it is legal in C to cast any struct pointer to a pointer to the struct's
first element, the pointer to a closure can be cast to a pointer-to-a-function-
pointer of the right type, taking the closure pointer as its first argument,
"_env", and the declared arguments as the rest.

Strictly speaking, this invokes undefined behaviour:

 int(* cf)(void *, int) = (int(**)(void*,int))someClosure;
 cf(someClosure, 42);

...because the type of the first argument is not void *, but in practice it may
work ...sometimes.


 sizeof_cl(<return type>, <args>, <over>)

This macro returns the size of a struct containing elements of the same layout
as those in a closure with the described signature, which may be useful for
allocating buffer space in which to return closures. Example:

 // This closure...
 cl(int, (int a, int b), ((int, x), (int, y)), { return (x + y) * (a + b); });
 // ...should be "sized" by this expression:
 int sz = sizeof_cl(int, (int, int), (int, int));

Because of struct alignments and whatnot, this theoretically may not return the
correct size for the closure... but in practice, it almost certainly will as it
describes an identical data structure.


 _fe1(<function to call>, <lambda>, <other args>...)
 _fe2(<function to call>, <arg>, <lambda>, <other args>...)
 _fe3(<function to call>, <arg>, <arg>, <lambda>, <other args>...)
 _fe4(<function to call>, <arg>, <arg>, <arg>, <lambda>, <other args>...)
 _cle1(<function to call>, <closure>, <other args>...)
 _cle2(<function to call>, <arg>, <closure>, <other args>...)
 _cle3(<function to call>, <arg>, <arg>, <closure>, <other args>...)
 _cle4(<function to call>, <arg>, <arg>, <arg>, <closure>, <other args>...)

These macros provide the sole exception to the parenthesis rule for anonymous
functions and inline closures. An anonymous function or closure may appear in
the respective position marked "lambda" or "closure" for each form, using only
the procedure body rather than the fn() or cl() macro (see below: basically
just drop the "fn" or "cl").

The function in position zero will be called with the lambda as an argument,
along with any arguments appearing in the positions before or after it. If the
_feN form is being used, the function should accept a function pointer; and if
the _cleN form is being used, it should accept a closure pointer.

No syntactic form is provided with the lambda in position zero, since a fn()
form lambda may be called using direct C syntax (shown above), while doing so
with a closure is frankly more or less pointless.

The _feN and _cleN forms are statements, not expressions, and do not return any
value. To return a value, the easiest option would be to use an out-parameter
(possibly defining a wrapper function to pass it through).

Examples:

 // Assume gforeach and gmap are higher-order functions...
 _fe2(gforeach, glist((char*[]){"foo", "bar", "baz"}), (void, (char * c), {
     printf("%s: %d\n", c, strlen(c));
 }));
 
 GList * out; int k = 2;
 _fe2(gmap, glist((int[]){ 1, 2, 3, 4 }), (int, (int n), ((int, k)), {
     return n * k;
 }), &out);
 // "out" now contains { 2, 4, 6, 8 }


Final note on usage
-------------------

...you probably really shouldn't abuse poor innocent C in this way.
